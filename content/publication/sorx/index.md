abstract: "Soft robotics technology creates new ways for legged robots to interact with and adapt to their environment. We have developed (i) a new 2-degree-of-freedom soft pneumatic actuator, and (ii) a novel soft robotic hexapedal robot called SoRX that leverages the new actuators.
Simulation and physical testing confirm that the proposed actuator can generate cyclic foot trajectories that are appropriate for legged locomotion. Consistent with other hexapedal robots (and animals), SoRX employs an alternating tripod gait to propel itself forward. Experiments reveal that SoRX can reach forward speeds of up to 0.44 body lengths per second, or equivalently 101 mm/s. With a size of 230 mm length, 140 mm width and 100 mm height, and weight of 650 grams, SoRX is among the fastest tethered soft pneumatically-actuated legged robots to date.
The motion capabilities of SoRX are evaluated through five experiments: running, step climbing, and traversing rough terrain, steep terrain, and unstable terrain. Experimental results show that SoRX is able to operate over challenging terrains in open-loop control and by following the same alternating tripod gait across all experimental cases."
