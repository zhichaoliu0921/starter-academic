abstract: "Soft pneumatic legged robots offer promise in their ability
to navigate over a range of different types of terrain,
including natural unstructured terrain met in applications
like precision agriculture. They can adapt their body
morphology to the intricacies of the terrain at hand, thus
enabling robust and resilient locomotion. This paper
capitalizes on recent developments on soft pneumatic legged
robots to introduce a closed-loop trajectory tracking
control scheme with an eye to enabling autonomous
navigation for such robots. Closed-loop pneumatic actuation
feedback is made possible by introducing a compact and
mobile pneumatic regulation board. Experimental results
reveal that our soft legged robot can precisely control its
body height and orientation while in quasi-static operation
based on a geometric model. The robot can also track both
straight line and curved trajectories as well as
variable-height trajectories. "
